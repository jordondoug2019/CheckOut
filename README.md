# 2. Background & Context
This product is made by a teacher for teachers and admin. The end of the day at any school is always chaos. Students are confused about where they are going, who is picking them up. Specifically bus riders. I have been apart of the bus dismissal team at Grizzlies Prep for the past 2 years. Every week, a student is missing or late for the bus, staff is unable to have quick access to parent information, and we donâ€™t know which students are missing for the dismissal process.

# 3. Problem Statement
School staff currently lack a centralized system to manage bus rider dismissal, resulting in inefficiencies such as missing students, inaccurate headcounts, and delayed communication.
